        <li><p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that uses height and weight to estimate body fat in adults. 
            It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.</p></li>
            <li><p>While BMI is a useful screening tool, it does not directly measure body fat and may not be accurate for all individuals, 
                particularly those with high muscle mass, older adults, or certain ethnic groups. 
                It is often used alongside other assessments to evaluate an individual's overall health.</p></li>
